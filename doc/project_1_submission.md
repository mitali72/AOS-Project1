# Project 1 Submission

### 1. General Rule

* Submit your project only through **Canvas**.

   Other types of submission will not be accepted, e.g. email.

* Submit two files: program in tarball (``project_1_GTID.tar.gz``) and report in PDF (``project_1_GTID.pdf``).

* Name both files in this format ``project_1_GTID``, e.g. project\_1\_gburdell3. For more detail, please refer the [submission practice document](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/230122/files/folder/Projects?preview=28609465).

* Compress only the directory **gtthreads**.
	- Verify the ``Makefile`` inside working **correctly** on VM cluster to compile/run your program.
	- Do not pack the binary or metadata files, make sure to clean them (``$ make clean``) before archive your code.
	- Get necessary files or documents ready before you pack it. Like a more clear ``README`` for running your code.
    - Reference command for packing your code: ``$ tar -czvf project_1_GTID.tar.gz ./gtthreads``

* Don't forget replace GTID with your ID.

### 2. Late Policy

A penalty of 10% per day will be applied for late submissions for up to 3 days.
For instance, when your score is 90 with two-day late submission, your final score would be 90 x 0.8 = 72.
Submissions received more than 3 days late will receive no credit.
